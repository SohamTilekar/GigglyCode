# GigglyCode
GigglyCode is a unique programming language developed by SohamTilekar. It's designed as an educational tool for learning C++, but it's more than just a simple learning language.

## Current Status :construction:
Please note that GigglyCode is currently in the parsing stage of development. It's not yet ready for production use.

## Objective
The primary objective of GigglyCode is to facilitate inter-operability between different programming languages. It achieves this by supporting inline Python and C code. Future versions may include support for additional languages.

## Syntax
GigglyCode's syntax is heavily influenced by Python, with the key difference being the use of curly braces `{}` instead of indentation for block structuring. Here's a quick example to illustrate what GigglyCode looks like:

```python
def fizzbuzz(start, stop, step) {
  for i in range(start, stop, step) {
    if i % 15 == 0 {
      print('fizzbuzz');
    } elif i % 5 == 0 {
      print('buzz');
    } elif i % 3 == 0 {
      print('fizz');
    } else {
      print(i);
    }
  }
}
```
Stay tuned for more updates as GigglyCode continues to evolve!
